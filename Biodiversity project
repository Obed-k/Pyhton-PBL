It also supports economic opportunities, and leisure activities that contribute to overall wellbeing.\n Biodiversity loss has negative effects on several aspects of human well-being, such as food security, vulnerability to natural disasters, energy security, and access to clean water and raw materials. It also affects human health, social relations, and freedom of choice.")
